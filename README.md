# Funkuino

**Manage an [ESPuino](https://espuino.de) kids' audio player from your Mac —
library mirroring, printable RFID cards, and a web dashboard with an embedded
Claude agent.**

The [ESPuino](https://forum.espuino.de) is a wonderful DIY, RFID-controlled
audio player for children: put a card on the box, the story plays. What it
doesn't come with is comfortable tooling for the grown-up side of the workflow —
getting audio onto the device, keeping a library organised, and producing the
physical cards. Funkuino is that missing half: a Mac app you can double-click,
and the same tools as small, sharp command-line programs underneath.

**[Download Funkuino for macOS](https://github.com/sadilek/Funkuino/releases/latest)**
— a signed, notarised app for Apple Silicon (macOS 14+). It brings its own
Python and ffmpeg, so there is nothing to install first.

## Funkuino Studio

Studio is a dashboard covering the entire pipeline per card — Download ·
Cover · Sync · Print · RFID — where the status boxes are also the actions:
click a unit's sync box to upload it, select covers for printing via a floating
print bar, assign RFID cards straight from the library view.

- **Live RFID assignment:** Studio keeps a passive websocket to the device and
  hears every card placement. Put an unknown card on the box, click the row it
  should belong to — assigned (with sensible play-mode defaults per content
  type).
- **Integrated card printing** with the same manifest and `--undo` semantics as
  the command line — every cover as a thumbnail (newest first, printed ones
  greyed out), hand-pick covers onto a sheet or one-click the oldest full page:

- **Embedded Claude agent** (optional, [Claude Agent
  SDK](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/agent-sdk/overview)): paste a URL into
  the library tab and an agent session handles the intake — probe, classify
  (song/album/audiobook), download with the right flags, verify naming and
  covers, report back — asking *you* whenever a judgment call is needed
  (episode numbering, attribution, intro wording), via question cards in the
  browser. Permission model: read-only tools and the project's own commands are
  auto-allowed, risky ones always raise an approval card. Needs your own
  [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installation and a subscription
  token — the Agent tab walks you through both.

## The tools underneath

Studio is a front end for these; each is also a command of its own, and the
app puts them on your PATH as `funkuino <command>`.

- **`funkuino sync` — rsync-style mirror to the device.** One-way mirror of a local
  `files/` folder to the ESPuino over its HTTP API. Fast recursive listing,
  change detection via a local manifest (the device can't report file sizes
  cheaply), crash-safe incremental state (an interrupted upload is never
  trusted), size-scaled timeouts for big audiobook files, `--delete` with
  guard rails, automatic NFC/NFD Unicode normalisation (macOS vs. device), and
  per-device manifests keyed by MAC address — mirror the same library to two
  ESPuinos without confusion.
- **`funkuino download` — audio intake in the library's conventions.** A yt-dlp
  wrapper that lands audio as your library expects it: songs, albums with
  ordered track numbers, or audiobooks (Hörspiele) — multi-part episodes merged
  into a single MP3 with a spoken title intro (macOS `say`), correct tags, and
  the full-resolution title image saved separately for card printing (covers
  are deliberately *not* embedded in the audio: the device has no display and a
  large leading ID3 tag makes playback start-stutter).
- **`funkuino prepare` / `funkuino covers`** — the audiobook merge as a standalone tool, and
  batch extraction of embedded cover art from an existing library.
- **`funkuino cards` — printable RFID card sheets.** Lays title images out as
  edge-to-edge 6×6 cm squares on A4 PDFs (12 per page) with cut tick marks in
  the margins. Print, stick an RFID tag on each card's back, laminate, cut. A
  print manifest makes a bare `funkuino cards` mean "everything new since last
  time", with stackable `--undo`.

## Extensions — your own commands and your own agent

Some sources need handling the shipped `download` does not have, and everyone's
library has conventions of its own. Both are extendable without touching this
repository, because both live in *your* library folder:

- **`extensions/<name>.py` becomes `funkuino <name>`.** A script dropped there
  is run with the project's own modules importable, so it can reuse the
  download pipeline, the naming rules and the device client. The one that grew
  this mechanism reconstructs complete audiobook series from a YouTube Music
  "Topic" channel, where the shipped downloader only sees a jumble of chapter
  tracks. An optional `<name>.permissions.json` (`{"allow": [...], "ask": [...]}`)
  declares how the embedded agent may call it — an extension that declares
  nothing simply needs your approval every time.
- **`CLAUDE.md` in your library folder teaches the agent your conventions.**
  It is loaded into every agent session on top of the project's own
  instructions: how you want a particular series named, that a certain source
  needs cookies, which play mode a kind of content should get. This is how the
  intake flow learns your habits instead of you repeating them per download.

## Install

Download the DMG from
[Releases](https://github.com/sadilek/Funkuino/releases/latest), drag the app
to Applications, start it. On first launch it asks for two things: where your
library should live (a normal folder — put it on an external disk if you like)
and your ESPuino's name or IP. Nothing else to install: the app carries its own
Python runtime and a purpose-built ffmpeg.

![First launch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sadilek/Funkuino/main/docs/screenshots/einrichtung.png)

**Two limitations to know before you download:**

- **The interface is German only.** The tools, the code and this documentation
  are English, but every label and message a user sees is German. Translations
  would be welcome.
- **The app is Apple Silicon only** (macOS 14+). The bundled Python is
  single-architecture, so an Intel build has to be built on an Intel Mac —
  possible (`make release` in `mac/`), just not something I can produce here.
  On Linux, install it with pipx instead (below); there the same Studio runs in
  your browser.

### Linux (and Windows via WSL)

There is no app bundle outside macOS, but Studio and every command are plain
Python and run anywhere:

```bash
pipx install funkuino
sudo apt install ffmpeg        # or dnf/pacman/zypper — funkuino tells you which

funkuino studio                # dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8800
funkuino sync --dry-run        # see what would be uploaded
funkuino cards                 # printable PDF of the new covers
```

The library then defaults to `~/Funkuino/` (change it with `funkuino --data-dir`
or a `data_dir` entry in `~/.config/funkuino/config.json`), and configuration
follows the platform: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/funkuino` on Linux,
`%APPDATA%\Funkuino` on Windows.

Two things differ from macOS: the spoken intro in front of merged audiobooks
uses macOS' `say` and is skipped elsewhere (the merge itself runs normally), and
a finished print sheet is not opened for you — it is written to
`print-sheets/`. Windows currently needs WSL, since the `./sync`-style wrappers
are shell scripts; the `funkuino …` commands themselves do not depend on a
shell.

### From source

The same tools work without any installation, and that is how they are
developed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sadilek/Funkuino.git
cd Funkuino
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

./sync --dry-run        # see what would be uploaded (files/ -> device)
./cards                 # lay out new cover images as a printable PDF
./studio                # open the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8800
```

`bin/funkuino <command>` is the same entry point the app uses; the `./sync`,
`./download`, … wrappers in the root are one-liners onto it. A checkout keeps
its library in the checkout, so cloning and running changes nothing outside it.

Requirements for the source route: Python ≥ 3.10 and **ffmpeg** on PATH.

Configuration: CLI flags > `ESPUINO_*` env vars > defaults (`ESPUINO_HOST`,
`ESPUINO_LOCAL_DIR`, `ESPUINO_REMOTE_ROOT`, `ESPUINO_HTTP_USER`/`_PASSWORD`).
`FUNKUINO_DATA_DIR` (or `funkuino --data-dir`) points the whole installation at
a different library folder — that is what the app configures for you.

## Library conventions

One RFID card = one *unit* of content, derived from file layout alone — no
database:

| Unit | Layout |
|------|--------|
| Song | `files/Lieder/<Artist> - <Title>.mp3` |
| Album | `files/<Artist> - <Album>/<NN> <Title>.mp3` |
| Audiobook episode | `files/<Series>/<NNN> - <Title>.mp3` (one merged file) |
| Multi-story episode | `files/<Series>/Folge <N>/<NN> <Story>.mp3` (folder = card, stories navigable with prev/next) |

Cover images mirror the same paths under `card-covers/` (one image per card).

A library folder holds `files/`, `card-covers/`, `print-sheets/` and a visible
`status/` with the sync and print manifests — nothing hidden, so moving the
library by hand cannot silently leave its state behind. Your Claude token is
deliberately *not* in there: it lives with the installation, in
`~/Library/Application Support/Funkuino/` (or `~/.config/funkuino/` on Linux).

## Hard-won device knowledge

`CLAUDE.md` documents the ESPuino's HTTP API and a collection of quirks that
took real debugging to learn — mDNS resolution cost, SD-writer wedging, why
FTP is useless for diffing, NFC/NFD filename mismatches, and a full root-cause
analysis of the PN5180 "resting card briefly lost during playback" problem
(fixed upstream in ESPuino PR #444). If you script against an ESPuino, read it
before relearning any of this the hard way.

## A note on content

`./download` is a thin convenience wrapper around
[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) that organises audio into the
library conventions above. Only download content you are entitled to download.

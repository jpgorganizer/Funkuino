"""Local upload manifest for the ESPuino mirror.

The device offers no cheap way to read a remote file's size (see espuino.py), so
we cannot tell "changed" from "unchanged" by asking the device. Instead we keep
a local record of what we last uploaded -- remote path -> (size, mtime) -- and
compare the local files against it. Existence is still verified against the
device (a fast, safe directory listing); this manifest only answers "did the
*content* change since we last pushed it?".

The manifest is keyed by the device's MAC address (its stable hardware
identity), so the same files can be mirrored to several ESPuinos independently,
and one device reached under different names (hostname vs IP) still shares a
single manifest. The host name is kept only as a human-readable label. Manifests
are machine-specific and git-ignored.

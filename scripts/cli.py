"""`funkuino <command> [args…]` — the command dispatcher.

This is the single implementation. `bin/funkuino` (checkout and macOS bundle)
picks the right interpreter in shell and then calls straight into here, and the
installed console script is this module's ``main`` — so there is one dispatcher,
not one per packaging.

A command <name> is the module ``<name>.py`` next to this file — or, for
anything not shipped, ``<data folder>/extensions/<name>.py``. The extensions
directory is the supported place for private or machine-local tooling: the code
root is read-only both in the packaged app and in site-packages, so nothing may
be installed into the shipped set.

Why a dispatcher at all, rather than one console script per command: the Studio
agent's permission rules are TEXT patterns matched against the Bash command line
(studio_agent.py ALLOWED_TOOLS / ASK_RULES). A bare, canonical `funkuino sync …`
is what those patterns match, no matter where code and data live — and keeping
the *subcommand* in the matched string is what stops an "always allow" on a
harmless command from generalising to all of them.

Commands run in-process (``runpy``), not as a grandchild interpreter: it saves a
process spawn per invocation and keeps Ctrl+C landing on the command itself,
which matters for sync's crash-safe manifest handling.
